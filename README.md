For Security purposes, all php files that access the database used to manage login information, articles, comments, and other data have been edited, and the password and database address blanked out.  
Files uploaded to Github have been rearranged into folder for better readability and organization. This also means that references to files will not work anymore as it did in the original website, where all files were in one main folder. (was not as well organized)  
  
The website address is set to expire sometime late 2017.
